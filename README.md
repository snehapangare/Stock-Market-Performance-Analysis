 # Stock Market Performance Analysis

This project involves the analysis of the stock market performance of Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google over the past three months. Various data science techniques were employed to comprehensively evaluate the performance of these companies, including the identification of trends and patterns in stock price movements, calculation of moving averages, assessment of volatility, and correlation analysis between different stock prices.

### Data Collection and Processing

The historical stock price data for the mentioned companies was obtained using the `yfinance` library in Python. The data was collected for the past three months and subsequently processed and analyzed using Pandas and Plotly libraries for visualization.

### Analysis Techniques

1. **Visual Comparison:** The stock prices of the companies were visually compared through line and area charts, allowing for the identification of trends and patterns in stock price movements.

2. **Moving Averages:** Moving averages were calculated for each company to assess trends and patterns over time. The calculated moving averages were further visualized to illustrate the stock price trends.

3. **Volatility Measurement:** Volatility for each company was measured, and the volatility of all companies was visualized to distinguish between high and low volatility, providing insights into the nature and frequency of price movements in the market.

4. **Correlation Analysis:** A correlation analysis was conducted, focusing specifically on the relationship between the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft. This revealed a strong linear relationship between the stock prices of the two companies, suggesting a high degree of correlation or similarity.

### Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis provided a deeper understanding of the factors influencing stock prices and the relationships between different companies in the stock market. It successfully demonstrated the application of data science techniques in analyzing stock market performance, offering valuable insights for investors and market analysts.
